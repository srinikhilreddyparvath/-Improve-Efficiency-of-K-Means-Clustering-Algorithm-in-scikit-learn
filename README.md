# -Improve-Efficiency-of-K-Means-Clustering-Algorithm-in-scikit-learn
 In this pull request, I optimized the K-Means clustering algorithm by implementing a more efficient initialization method, which reduces the number of iterations required for convergence. This enhancement significantly improves the performance of the algorithm, especially for large datasets.
